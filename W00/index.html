<p>When you think about computers, don’t just imagine spreadsheets or engineering tools. Think of them as media machines — instruments for imagination, expression, and culture. In this class, you’re not learning code just to calculate or automate; you’re learning it to make, play, and express yourself.</p>

<p>We’ll be using p5.js, which was created to make programming approachable for artists and designers. Instead of walls of intimidating syntax, you get a canvas in the browser and simple commands like <pre>ellipse()</pre> and <pre>rect()</pre>. You don’t need a computer science degree to use it — you only need curiosity and the willingness to experiment.</p>

<p>You’ll start with the fundamentals: the canvas, coordinates, and functions. You’ll learn how to give arguments and parameters to those functions, and how the code runs top to bottom in a repeating loop. Even the simplest sketch — a circle drawn at a position, a rectangle with color — is the seed of something larger. From there, you’ll build systems of interaction, animation, and critique.</p>

<p>Most importantly, you’ll learn to see differently. You’ll start seeing software as a set of choices, systems, and rules — not as something handed down by tech companies, but as something you can shape. Coding gives you control beyond “point-and-click” presets. It lets you build your own tools, reflect on culture, and even challenge power.</p>

<p>This is your invitation: treat code as generative, conceptual, and critical. And remember — from the very first circle you draw, you’re not just programming a computer, you’re starting a conversation with it.</p>

<H2>Introducing Interactivity & the Button</H2>

<p>Up until now, we’ve thought about code as a way to draw shapes on a canvas — circles, rectangles, colors. But interactivity changes everything.</p>

<p>When you add interactivity, your sketch stops being a static picture and becomes a conversation. The computer doesn’t just show you something; it responds to you.</p>

<p>The simplest unit of interactivity is the button. A button is a tiny contract between you and the system: “When I press this, something happens.”</p>


<li>A momentary button acts only while you hold it down.
<li>A latching button holds its state until you press it again.
<li>But even the most basic button introduces the key ideas of input, condition, and response.


<H3>Processing Code Example: Button → Background Red</H3>
